# Pributan

This theme is based on One Dark Pro for Visual Studio Code. There are several changes that I have made, which are as follows:

#### Added:
* border
* color hover on the text (on the side bar and on the tab bar)
* darker editor background
* Color sidebar, activitybar, titlebar, statusbar, titlebar become one color

#### Removed:
* scrollbar shadow
* highlight line
* indent guide (in the sidebar / tree and in the editor)

> This theme is brought for you who like simplicity, cool, and stay focused
